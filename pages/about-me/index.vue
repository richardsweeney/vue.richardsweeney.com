          <p class="is-size-4">I'm a full-stack dev. I'm Irish and I've been living in Malm√∂ in Sweden since 2006.</p>
          <p>I work as a developer architect at <a target="_blank" href="https://angrycreative.se">Angry Creative</a> which builds awesome stuff mostly using WordPress and WooCommerce.</p>
          <p>Most of the time I work with Vue.js, React, Laravel, WordPress & WooCommerce and a large part of my work involves advising and assiging colleagues as well as product owners on various programming issues.</p>
          <p><strong>This site</strong> is built in <a target="_blank" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> (I do like React, but Vue is just a <em>teeny</em> bit cooler) - specificly <a target="_blank" href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a> which handles, SSR and routing really nicely. I use a headless WordPress as the backend and fetch content via the Rest API. I added one custom route to fetch posts via slug instead of ID. Nuxt is a really sweet framework that very much keeps in style with how clean and lovely Vue is to work with. You should try it!</p>
          <p>I used <a target="_blank" href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a> as a CSS framework (I'm <em>not</em> a designer), which is like Bootstrap, but <em>slightly</em> cooler.</p>
